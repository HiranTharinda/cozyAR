## Place it Like you Mean It - Augemented Reality Furniture!

### Introduction
“Cozy” is an Augmented Reality and Artificial Intelligence based android app designed to make selecting furniture much more easy and fun task. “Cozy” gives the customers the ability to easily place any product in any space using Augmented Reality and decide if it truly fit in to their place.
That’s not it! It uses specially trained Neural network to scan the space and identify the existing items in the room and then it will automatically identify whether it is a living room, kitchen, bedroom etc. That will decide what kind of furniture this room needs and will suggest the best matching items the store can offer for the customer.
